Being a lazy hobbyist game developer for the last 8 years tought me that games are just too damn hard to make. And one of the hardest parts, at least for me, is Game Design.

## No new ideas anymore

There are so many games coming out every day that it's no wonder there's no real "new ideas" anymore. As a casual game developer I've come to realize that the real winning strategy nowadays is to take an existing kind of game and try to add a unique twist on top of it.

Designing a game from the ground up is bound to result in failure. It's what I've always tried to do as a hobbyist. I wanted to create games that mixed many mechanics, that felt and played like something unique. It seems, however, that reusing the tried and tested game archetypes is the only realistic way to create and ship new games, and you can learn a lot from those games coming out now that succeeded in this aspect.

## Don't reinvent the wheel, make it unique and better

Just changing the wrapping around some existing mechanics might be enough in most cases: a unique setting, a different "feel", different aesthetic... Why change a game design that already works?

But you could also try varying some of the mechanics, without changing the core reason the game is fun. This is what I've been trying to do recently (without success), so I've come to admire the games that clearly originated from an existing archetype, but managed to improve on it and add unique twists. I think these are realistic examples of *"game design done right"*: rather than focusing on the famous games that created an archetype (Minecraft, Binding of Isaac), one should focus on the games that came after and improved upon them.
