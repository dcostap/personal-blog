As one of many programmers who started learning coding with OOP-style languages, my way of thinking about code is always biased towards OOP. Even after learning to prevent its overuse (and to appreciate simple and straightforward code), I still find myself gravitating towards structuring the code in terms of classes - methods - properties. 

I think the namespacing that a class offers is great, even though it may lead to complexity when linking data with behavior. Should it be a method of this class? Should it be a static method? Should it be just a global function?

Having to bundle data and behavior together, and thus having to think about what exactly a class encompasses, brings these kind of philosophical questions that you are forced to answer.

    If you follow the advice of the object oriented programming gurus, writing code then begins to feel like you're having to solve the problems of analytical philosophy and platonic essentialism. You have to constantly question the nature of the entities you're creating.

It's one of the points many OOP haters bring up when discussing how ridiculous the OOP mindset is.

But, how do these people write code, exactly? What can I learn from the way they structure their code?
