I guess this will be a kinda scuffed review from someone that doesn't really know how to review games. In fact, this is probably my first time doing something similar, but I felt like sharing my thoughts on a game I love.

## The 'Souls' series

I always liked the Souls games, and I think there's always been two aspects to them that drew in: the **world building** and the **challenge**.

**The world building** is something quite unique to the first Dark Souls game. I love exploring in games. I loathe when games have a minimap always present in the screen, and you follow some points or arrows. In the first Dark Souls, the world really felt connected and well designed, and it's a reason of why I remember this game so fondly. Latter entries, including Sekiro, don't do this kind of world building so well, but they do it well enough.

**The challenge** is the staple and what everyone associates with these games. From Software clearly made a mark in the gamedev industry. I think it was about time someone made high budget games that focused on the challenge, like the "good old days". Don't get me wrong, I love the AAA releases that put their budget on story and graphics. For me, immersion is as big of a factor to enjoy a game as challenge. But while plenty of developers managed to achieve that immersion, no one achieves challenge like From Software. And oh boy did they knock it out of the park with Sekiro.


## So yeah I like Sekiro's combat I guess

For the last 4 or 5 years I've been through the start of a programmer's journey.

At the very start, you just focus on learning the syntax and the basics.

Later on, you start to learn about the good and bad practices. As it turns out, there's a lot of design and architecture work behind every codebase.

I learned about design patterns, and popular books like Clean Code.

I learned what kind of languages are generally more hated, and which ones are loved.

**Eventually, I formed my own opinions**. I seem to gravitate towards simplicity. I loathe the over-engineering encouraged by enterprise coding practices. I don't like 99% of the advice exposed in the famous Clean Code book (luckily, [it seems that I am not alone in this](https://qntm.org/clean)).

## The beauty of simple code

I see beauty in simple code. I love the feeling of writing your first lines of code when starting a project, before everything turns into a complex and unreadable mess.

And suddenly, I am starting to feel attracted to simpler languages like C or Jai.

I look forward to the day Jai releases, but I will probably still go back to Kotlin. After all, the complexity it introduces is still optional, and its language design does focus on reducing boilerplate and redundancy.

It's up to the developer to not use too many of the advanced features, that are probably unnecessary.
