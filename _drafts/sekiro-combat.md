I guess this will be a kinda scuffed review from someone that doesn't really know how to review games, but I felt like writing down my thoughts on a game I love.

## The 'Souls' series

I always liked the Souls games, and I think there's always been two aspects to them that drew in: the **world building** and the **challenge**.

**The world building** is something quite unique to the first Dark Souls game. I love exploring in games. I loathe when games have a minimap always present in the screen, and it seems like you are always following the minimap indications to get somewhere. In the first Dark Souls, the world felt connected and well designed, and it's one of the reasons I remember this game so fondly. Latter entries, including Sekiro, don't reach this level of map design but they get close enough.

**The challenge** is what everyone associates with these games. From Software clearly made a mark in the gamedev industry. I still very much enjoy AAA releases that focus their budget on story and graphics. For me, immersion in a virtual world is as big of a factor to enjoy a game as challenge. But while plenty of developers managed to achieve that immersion, no one achieves challenge like From Software.
